Final project for **INFSCI 2415 (Data Analytics)**, University of Pittsburgh  
Author: **Yingjing (Jessamine) Jiang**

## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world Sephora product and review data to study how **price**, **customer ratings**, **popularity**, and **value efficiency** interact across beauty brands.

### Guiding Questions
- Do higher-priced products receive higher ratings?  
- Which brands deliver the best rating-per-dollar value?  
- How are brands distributed across price tiers?  
- Does popularity (review volume) correspond to higher value?

All analysis is implemented in Python, and the results are summarized through statistical models and visualizations.

---

## 2. Key Results

- Price and rating show only a **weak correlation**; expensive products do not necessarily earn higher satisfaction.  
- Most brands fall into the **mid-range tier ($30–$60)**.  
- Value scores (rating ÷ price) vary widely; many premium/luxury brands perform poorly in value efficiency.  
- Review volume does not strongly predict value.  
- **Rosebud Perfume Co., Jack Black, and The Ordinary** rank among the strongest brands in value efficiency.

A complete written summary is available in the final PDF report.

### Data Processing
- Convert ratings and prices to numeric formats  
- Remove missing or invalid entries  
- Winsorize price extremes (1st and 99th percentiles)  
- Normalize brand names  
- Compute brand-level statistics:
  - Average rating  
  - Average price  
  - Review volume  
  - Value score (rating ÷ price)

### Statistical Modeling
- Weighted Least Squares (WLS) regression  
- Bootstrap confidence intervals  
- LOWESS smoothing
